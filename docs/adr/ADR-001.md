# ADR-001: Local Data Storage for MVP

## Context

FitTrack is an early-stage prototype built to demonstrate core software engineering practices rather than production-scale fitness tracking. The application is a browser-based Single Page Application developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Key constraints and forces influencing this decision include:

- No requirement for user authentication or multi-device synchronization
- Limited project timeline and scope
- Team preference to focus on frontend architecture, modularity, and CI workflows
- Desire to minimize infrastructure, deployment complexity, and backend maintenance
- Need for fast iteration, easy testing, and simple data persistence

We considered alternatives such as using a backend service with a database, but introducing a backend would add complexity and risk without providing meaningful value at this stage.

## Decision

We chose to store all application data locally in the user’s browser using the Web Storage API (Local storage).

Workout entries are serialized as JSON strings and read from or written to localStorage by the Single Page Application during user interactions. localStorage saves data on the user’s browser, keeps it even after the browser is closed, and can store about 5–10MB of data per website.

## Status

Accepted

## Consequences

### Positive Outcomes

- Removes the need for backend infrastructure
- Simplifies development, deployment, and testing
- Supports rapid prototyping within MVP constraints

### Negative Consequences / Risks

- Data is browser-specific and not shared across devices
- Stored data can be cleared by the user
- Not suitable for multi-user scenarios or production-scale use

### Future Considerations

If the project expands beyond the MVP, this decision can be revisited. A backend database could replace localStorage without major changes to the frontend architecture.
